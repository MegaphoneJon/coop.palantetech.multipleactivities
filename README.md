# coop.palantetech.multipleactivities
A client-specific CiviCRM extension we used to implement copying activities and implement creating multiple activities.

This is client-specific, and was written against CiviCRM 4.4 - some of the recurring activity functionality built here
is superseded by the recurring activity engine in CiviCRM 4.6.  I'm posting this for educational purposes for folks
who need to know who to build an extension that copies activities.
